# FAQ

### Why not use windi.css instead?
- No good answer at the moment.  Seeking max compatibility and may later switch for better performance if the tailwind JIT project doesn't suffice.

### Why React?
- The size of the existing components already out there, plus extensibility.

### Why Astro?
- I hate mono apps, and I really hate mono SPA apps.  I like the idea of creating React apps and being able to have them contained on different pages within the MPA provided by Astro.
